## 🧠 OOP Concepts Used

These projects demonstrate core **OOP principles**:

* 🔐 **Encapsulation** — Bundling data & methods inside classes
* 🧊 **Abstraction** — Hiding complexity, exposing only essentials
* 🧬 **Inheritance** — Base structure ready for future extensions
* 🔁 **Polymorphism** — Reusable behaviors via method overloading/overriding
* 🧱 **Classes & Objects** — Real-world entities modeled in code

---

## ⚙️ How to Run

1. 💻 **Compile the code** for the desired project (see above).
2. 🏁 **Run the main class** specific to that project.
3. 🖥️ **Follow the console instructions**.

---

## 📝 Notes

* 💾 All data is stored **in-memory only** (no file/database).
* 🧼 Each project is clean, beginner-friendly, and modular.
* 🧪 Some projects create **default/test data** when starting.

## 👨‍💻 Authors

Developed as a collection of mini-projects for learning and demonstrating **Java OOP** and **console application development**.
